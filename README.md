# glTF to USDZ

Proof of concept of converting glTF to USDZ for AR Quick Look (iOS 12+).

## Reasoning

Even though I think the intensions of Apple / Pixar are great with the open source [USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) pipeline I think we as an industry should be relying more on truly open formats that are not controlled by a single entity. Installing `USD` is cumbersome, requires a lot of disk space and is completely overkill for most situations (if your goal is to convert some 3D models to USDZ and show them using `AR Quick Look`). I'm hoping that as we get closer to the public release of `iOS 12` more tools will pop up that directly convert to `USDZ` so that we can get cross-platform support.

In order to move away from using the [USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) pipeline solution offered by Pixar I think it would be wise to try and manipulate the intermediary readeable `USDA` format. Unfortunately there are very little examples available of `USDA` files.

My idea is to dynamically generate / manipulate the intermediary a general `USDA` file-structure and pass that to the `usdz-converter` to handle the further conversion to `USDZ`.

After some work, debugging and friendly help from [@domenicopanacea](https://twitter.com/domenicopanacea/status/1011577221310447618) and [@virakri](https://twitter.com/virakri/status/1010356558742589440) I got it to work. Most of the findings on OBJ support come from `trayser` who posted details regarding OBJ to `USDZ` conversion on [developers.apple.com](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/104042). The OBJ files that are generated by `gltf-to-usdz` only use the supported tags as mentioned by `trayser`.

Please note that this is just an experimental setup and should be seen as a proof of concept.

## Live demo

[Live demo](https://timvanscherpenzeel.github.io/gltf-to-usdz/)

## Limitations

- `.glb` files are not yet accepted. Please use `glTF` files with seperate textures.

- Only the first mesh in the `glTF` file will be parsed and exported. Make sure you merge all meshes.

- Only `glTF` files with external textures are currently handled (as opposed to embedded base64 encoded textures).

## To do

- Convert the example `USDZ` examples to `USDA` structures by converting `USDC` to `USDA`. Unfortunately I think this requires the installation of the [USD pipeline](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) and the use of [usdcat](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/blob/e6ce9e884a65e7d6acd762e9dbc961dcf9aa36bb/pxr/usd/bin/usdcat/usdcat.py).

  I have not yet been able to install [USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) correctly, please see the development section below.

## Installation

- Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed

- Upgrade your operating system to macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 or newer

- Download Xcode 10 beta and put it in `/Applications/`

```
https://developer.apple.com/download/
```

- Link to the beta version instead of the normal version

```
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode-beta.app
```

- Construct a new `.usda` using `gltf-to-usdz` and run it through the `usdz_converter`

```
node ./bin/gltf-to-usdz.js -i ./assets/DamagedHelmet/DamagedHelmet.gltf -o ./assets/DamagedHelmet.usda -s 10.0 && xcrun usdz_converter ./assets/DamagedHelmet.usda ./assets/DamagedHelmet-`date +"%H-%M-%S"`.usdz
```

- On succes the following should be outputted to the console

```
2018-06-20 17:21:23.364 usdz_converter[82749:13335731]


Converting asset file 'DamagedHelmet.usda' ...
```

In order to see the contents of the outputted `USDZ` change the extension to `.zip` and unzip it. You will see a `.usdc` and several textures (if the original glTF file had textures).

## Development

In order to install [USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) on MacOS please follow the following instructions:

- Upgrade your operating system to macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 or newer

- Download Xcode 10 beta and put it in `/Applications/`

```
https://developer.apple.com/download/
```

- Link to the beta version instead of the normal version

```
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode-beta.app
```

- Install Cmake and QT. If you get any [issues](https://github.com/TimvanScherpenzeel/gltf-to-usdz/issues/1) during compiling or installing you might have to install QT5.

```
brew install cmake
brew install qt@4
```

- Install PyOpenGL

```
pip install PyOpenGL
```

- Install PySide2

```
pip install --index-url=http://download.qt.io/snapshots/ci/pyside/5.9/latest/ pyside2 --trusted-host download.qt.io
```

- Update OpenImageIO release version from `Release-1.7.14.zip` to `Release-1.8.12.zip` in `build_scripts/build_usd.py`.

- Run `python USD/build_scripts/build_usd.py BUILD`, it will take roughly 1 hour, resulting in the following output if succesfully installed:

```

Unfortunately I have the following error when running `usdcat`:

```

## Contributing

As it is my goal to create a community project I welcome you to submit any pull requests or open a ticket if you spot an issue. Please be aware that as of now the project is in a very experimental state and only serves as a proof of concept so there are probably lots of things wrong and the code is far from clean.
